# Simple Calculator

## Overview
This project is a **Simple Calculator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations with an intuitive user interface. The calculator includes features such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses for more complex calculations.

## Features
- Clean and responsive UI design.
- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Support for parentheses to group calculations.
- Real-time calculation and error handling.

## File Structure
- **`index.html`**: Defines the structure of the calculator, including the display and buttons.  
- **`styles.css`**: Provides styling for the calculator, including layout, colors, and hover effects.  
- **`script.js`**: Contains JavaScript functions for handling button clicks, clearing the display, and performing calculations.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the buttons to perform calculations:
   - Enter numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons.
   - Click the `=` button to calculate the result.
   - Use the `C` button to clear the display.

## How It Works
- **HTML**: Lays out the calculator display and buttons in a grid format.
- **CSS**: Ensures a visually appealing and responsive interface.
- **JavaScript**:
  - The `appendToDisplay(value)` function adds a value to the display.
  - The `clearDisplay()` function clears the display input.
  - The `calculateResult()` function evaluates the current input and displays the result. Errors are handled gracefully.
